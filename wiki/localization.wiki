= How do localization =

In site folder lang you will see folders with abbreviated names of languages (ex. rus, eng, uak)
each name of lang should have 3 symbols 
create folder with name of language wich you want localizate,
next install on site all modules witch you want see on site
next copy all files from rus folder in your language folder location witch you want to do, rename all files for you lang name
(ex. we have rus_guildtop.php but copy this file into uak, so we should rename it uak_guildtop.php)
when all files will be renamed, open first of it and rewrite russian (for example) letters to  letters witch you want.
when all files will be translated go to your site and choose new language.
